A word guessing game buildt with JavaScript and OOP(Object-Oriented Programming).

The game makes the player look for a hidden phrase by using the on screen or physical keyboard. 

The original HTML and CSS was provided to me, but I've built the JS part of the app. 

I've changed the CSS to personlize it a bit.
This includes:

- changing the position of the restart button to make for a better UX.
- changed the margin of the header in the restart window to make it look better. 
- made the games background an image while not in the start/restart overlay
- changed the color theme in the game to better fit the background image. 
- added text-shadow to the in-game header to make it more visible on the background image. 
- added hover effect to buttons.
